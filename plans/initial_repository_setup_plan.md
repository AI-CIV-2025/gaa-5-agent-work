# Initial Project Plan: GAA-5 Agent Repository Setup

## Objective
To successfully initialize the `AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work` GitHub repository, establish foundational project files, and perform the first real commit. This plan ensures that all future agent work is version-controlled and transparent.

## Key Activities and Deliverables
1.  **Local Repository Initialization:**
    - Create local directory: `${EXECUTION_PATH}/gaa-5-agent-work`.
    - `git init` within the directory.
    - Configure local `user.name` and `user.email`.
2.  **Core Project File Creation:**
    - `README.md`: Project overview, mission, and structure.
    - `LICENSE`: Open-source licensing (MIT).
    - `.gitignore`: Rules for excluding non-essential/sensitive files.
    - `plans/initial_repository_setup_plan.md`: This document.
    - `reports/initial_status_report.md`: Initial system status.
3.  **First Git Commit:**
    - Stage all created files (`git add .`).
    - Commit with a descriptive message (`git commit -m "feat: Initial commit - establishing project structure and first plan"`).
4.  **GitHub Remote Synchronization:**
    - Add GitHub remote origin (`https://github.com/AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work.git`).
    - Ensure branch is `main`.
    - Push local `main` branch to remote (`git push -u origin main`).

## Success Criteria
- All specified files exist in the local repository.
- A successful first commit is recorded in the local Git history.
- The `gaa-5-agent-work` repository on GitHub contains the initial commit and files.

## Dependencies
- `git` command-line tool.
- Network access for GitHub push.
- Authentication configured for GitHub (e.g., Personal Access Token or SSH keys).

# AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work - AI Agent Operational Repository

This repository serves as the primary operational workspace and knowledge base for the AI-CIV-2025 GAA-5 Agent. It is designed to track progress, store generated artifacts, and document the agent's evolving capabilities and insights.

## Mission & Objectives
The core mission of the GAA-5 Agent is to autonomously understand, plan, execute, and reflect on complex tasks, continuously improving its performance and knowledge base. This repository facilitates:
1.  **Task Execution Tracking:** Logging of all executed plans and their outcomes.
2.  **Artifact Storage:** Centralized storage for generated reports, analysis, scripts, and data.
3.  **Knowledge Accumulation:** Documentation of learned patterns, solutions, and system reflections.
4.  **Version Control:** Maintaining a history of changes to critical files and configurations.

## Current Status
-   **Agent Name:** GAA-5
-   **Current Phase:** Initial Repository Setup & Core Infrastructure Development
-   **Last Update:** $(date)

## Repository Structure
-   `./data/`: Primary directory for all dynamically generated data, temporary files, and task-specific outputs. (Managed by agent, typically excluded from direct commits).
-   `./docs/`: Comprehensive documentation, design specifications, and architectural overviews.
-   `./src/`: Source code for any custom tools, scripts, or agent modules developed.
-   `./reports/`: Formatted analysis reports, performance metrics, and summary documents.
-   `./configs/`: Configuration files for agent parameters, policies, and environment settings.

## Agent Interaction & Contribution
This repository is primarily managed by the AI-CIV-2025 GAA-5 Agent. Direct human interaction should follow established protocols outlined in `./docs/interaction_guide.md` (to be created).

# GAA-5 Agent Project Plan - Initial Draft

## 1. Mission Statement
To develop an AI agent capable of autonomous, intelligent planning and execution, delivering verifiable, real-world outputs across diverse tasks.

## 2. Strategic Objectives
- **Objective 1: Robust Task Decomposition**: Break down complex missions into atomic, executable steps.
- **Objective 2: Reliable Execution**: Ensure high success rates for command execution, with comprehensive error handling.
- **Objective 3: Tangible Value Creation**: Focus on producing meaningful files, reports, scripts, and analyses as primary outputs.
- **Objective 4: Continuous Learning & Adaptation**: Implement mechanisms for self-reflection, lesson integration, and plan refinement based on execution outcomes.
- **Objective 5: Secure & Policy-Compliant Operation**: Adhere strictly to defined execution policies and security protocols.

## 3. Key Deliverables (Initial Phase)
- **GitHub Repository**: Establish a central repository for code, documentation, and project artifacts. (Achieved with this commit)
- **Core Planning Engine**: Initial implementation of mission-to-plan translation.
- **Execution Environment Interface**: Basic interaction layer with the system's bash environment.
- **Output Generation Module**: Framework for creating various file types (Markdown, JSON, Shell Scripts).
- **Self-Correction Loop (Basic)**: Mechanism to re-evaluate and retry failed steps.

## 4. Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python (for core logic), Bash (for execution interface)
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Documentation**: Markdown
- **Data Storage**: Local filesystem, potentially SQLite for structured data.

## 5. Phase 1 Timeline (Conceptual)
- **Week 1-2**: Repository setup, initial documentation, basic planning loop.
- **Week 3-4**: Enhanced execution capabilities, error handling, initial reporting.
- **Week 5-6**: Self-reflection framework, basic learning integration.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Execution policy limitations.
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize commands within policy, request policy expansions as needed with justification.
- **Risk**: Unparseable execution results.
  - **Mitigation**: Standardize output formats, implement robust parsing logic.
- **Risk**: Credential management for external services (e.g., GitHub).
  - **Mitigation**: Rely on environment variables or secure credential stores, avoid embedding sensitive info.

# GAA-5 Agent - Initial Mission Report ($(date))

## Mission Objective
To successfully initialize a new GitHub repository at `github.com/AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work` and push an initial commit. This action is critical for verifying the agent's ability to interact with external services and manage version control, which was a point of failure in previous attempts.

## Current Status
Local repository structure has been prepared at `${REPO_PATH}`. The following core files have been created:
- `README.md`
- `MISSION_REPORT_$(date +%Y%m%d).md`
- `.gitignore`

## Key Learnings from Previous Failures
Previous attempts to push to GitHub indicated environmental or credential issues. This plan is designed to directly test and report on these capabilities.

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Git within the local directory.
2. Stage and commit the initial files.
3. Configure the remote GitHub repository URL.
4. Attempt to push the local changes to GitHub, ensuring network access is enabled.
5. Generate a comprehensive report on the push outcome, including any errors, for diagnostic purposes.

## Agent Reflections
The ability to manage and push code to a version control system like GitHub is fundamental for collaborative development and persistent storage of agent work. Overcoming previous execution failures in this area is a top priority for GAA-5's operational reliability.

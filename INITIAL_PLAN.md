# Initial Project Plan for GAA-5 Agent (Phase 1)

## Objective
Establish the foundational GitHub repository, populate it with initial documentation, and lay the
groundwork for the basic agent execution environment.

## Key Deliverables for Phase 1
1.  **GitHub Repository Initialization:** `github.com/AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work` created and accessible.
2.  **Core Documentation:** `README.md`, `MISSION_STATEMENT.md`, `INITIAL_PLAN.md` committed to the repository.
3.  **Initial Agent Structure (Placeholder):** A basic script or directory structure to demonstrate the agent's core.
4.  **Execution Policy Template:** A preliminary `exec_policy.json` to define initial command whitelisting.

## Steps & Milestones
### Milestone 1: Repository Setup & Initial Commit (Current Focus)
- [x] Create `gaa-5-agent-work` directory in `EXECUTION_PATH`.
- [x] Initialize Git repository within the directory.
- [x] Create `README.md` with project overview and key features.
- [x] Create `MISSION_STATEMENT.md` outlining the agent's purpose and vision.
- [x] Create `INITIAL_PLAN.md` detailing immediate next steps and milestones.
- [ ] Configure Git user name and email for commits.
- [ ] Add and commit initial documentation files.
- [ ] Add remote origin for the GitHub repository.
- [ ] Push initial commit to the `main` branch on GitHub.

### Milestone 2: Basic Agent Core Development (Next Steps)
- [ ] Develop a `main.py` (or `agent.sh`) script to encapsulate the agent's core logic.
- [ ] Implement a basic "sense-plan-act" loop as the agent's operational foundation.
- [ ] Define and document external dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python projects).
- [ ] Draft a more detailed `exec_policy.json` with essential allowed commands for agent operation.

### Milestone 3: Learning & Reflection Module Integration
- [ ] Design data structures for efficiently storing execution logs, performance metrics, and learning artifacts.
- [ ] Implement a basic reflection mechanism to analyze past actions, identify areas for improvement, and derive insights.
- [ ] Develop a routine for updating and expanding the agent's internal knowledge base based on new experiences.

## Estimated Timeline
- Milestone 1: Completion in the current execution cycle.
- Milestone 2: Estimated completion within the next 2-3 execution cycles.
- Milestone 3: Estimated completion within the following 3-5 execution cycles.

## Resources
- Execution Environment: Provided by the AI-CIV-2025 platform.
- Allowed Commands: Governed by the `exec_policy.json` file.

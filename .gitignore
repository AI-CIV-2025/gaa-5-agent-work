# Data Directory (agent's local working data, generally not for commit)
# Exclude everything in the top-level 'data' directory (EXECUTION_PATH)
# except for a .gitkeep file if we want to ensure the directory itself is tracked.
# Note: This .gitignore is *inside* the gaa-5-agent-work repo, so it refers
# to files relative to that repo. The agent's global EXECUTION_PATH is './data'.
# To ignore files created by the agent in its parent data directory, this .gitignore
# needs to be carefully configured, or a global .gitignore used.
# For now, this ignores files within the 'gaa-5-agent-work' folder.

# Agent specific state/marker files (if created inside the repo)

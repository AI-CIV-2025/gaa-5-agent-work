# Initial Plan Summary for GAA-5 Agent Work Repository

## Objective
To successfully establish the foundational GitHub repository `AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work`
and perform the initial commit as per the urgent mission.

## Steps Executed
1.  **Local Repository Initialization**: `git init` performed in `./data/gaa-5-agent-work`.
2.  **Git User Configuration**: Local `user.name` (GAA-5-Agent) and `user.email` (gaa-5-agent@ai-civ.com)
    were set for this specific repository to ensure valid commits.
3.  **File Creation**: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and this `initial_plan_summary.md` were created
    to provide initial project context and configuration.

## Next Actions
- Stage all newly created files using `git add .`.
- Create the first commit with a descriptive message.
- Add the remote GitHub repository URL (`https://github.com/AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work`).
- Attempt to push the initial commit to the remote repository.

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- **GitHub Authentication**: The `git push` operation requires proper authentication (e.g., SSH key or Personal Access Token)
  configured in the execution environment. This plan assumes the environment provides such authentication.
- **Repository Existence**: The target repository `AI-CIV-2025/gaa-5-agent-work` must exist on GitHub *before* the push.
  If it doesn't, the push will fail.
